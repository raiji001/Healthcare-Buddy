# ü§ñ HealthCare Buddy
### Major Project (4th Year - 8th Semester)

HealthCare Buddy is a healthcare domain chatbot designed to simulate the diagnostic capabilities of a general physician. This chatbot, created using Python, aims to provide quick responses, offer medical information, and assist users in navigating their healthcare needs.

## üìú Brief Overview

A chatbot is an AI-driven software that can engage in conversation with humans via text or voice. Our project utilizes Python to build a healthcare chatbot, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate user-friendly interactions. The primary goal is to assist healthcare providers by improving patient interactions and enhancing their performance through a human-like interface.

Chatbots are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, customer service, call centers, and internet gaming. They are programmed to respond to messages, either consistently or adaptively, using machine learning to tailor responses to specific situations. In healthcare, chatbots help hospitals and clinics by connecting with potential patients, scheduling appointments, and providing access to necessary treatments. Despite concerns about the reliability of AI in critical sectors, healthcare chatbots offer round-the-clock support and accurate information, guiding patients effectively.

## üìù Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of maintaining regular health check-ups and adhering to prescribed medications. With the deferral of elective and preventive visits, there is a heightened need for reliable online healthcare support. Our project aims to bridge this gap, offering accurate information and guidance, thereby reducing the spread of misinformation.

## üìá Features

- **Registration Screen:** Allows users to create an account.
- **Sign-in Screen:** Enables users to log in to their accounts.
- **User Database:** Maintains a database for the user login system.
- **GUI-Based Chatbot:** Provides a graphical user interface for diagnosing health issues.
- **Doctor Recommendations:** Suggests appropriate doctors based on the user‚Äôs symptoms.

## üìã Modules Utilized

Our program employs several Python modules to function effectively:

1. **tkinter:** For GUI development.
2. **os:** For interacting with the operating system.
3. **webbrowser:** To open web pages.
4. **numpy:** For numerical computations.
5. **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
6. **matplotlib:** For plotting graphs.
7. **scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.

## üìú Algorithm

We use the Decision Tree algorithm for our chatbot, which is a supervised learning technique suitable for classification and regression tasks. The decision tree mimics human decision-making processes, making it intuitive and easy to understand. It classifies data by creating a tree structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
